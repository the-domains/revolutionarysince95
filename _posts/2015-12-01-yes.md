"Find a way to say yes to things"-Eric Schmidt. Saying the word "Yes" more than the word "No". Isn't it such an amazing concept, the idea of saying one word more than another and having your life change because so. I don't think I've ever taken time to say yes to every opportunity that I'm presented with. I would like to try, I'd also love it for someone to do it with me so we can compare results. Whoooos with me (this is where you start)
