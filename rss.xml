            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Welcome</h1><p>I'd like to thank you for coming on to my site. I have been looking for a median to express my thoughts and ideas for a while, and now that I have this site I'll be able to do so. You're welcome to stay, or go; it doesn't necessarily matter. What matters is that you understand that this is only an expression of myself, for me, and that you too should find a means of expression. I will post my thoughts, my philosophies, my lessons, my ups my downs, my stories, my memories, basically anything that comes to mind. Now that I have somewhere to bring my thoughts, I will do so openly. I hope that what I share with you will help you in some way, if it doesn't,  I suggest you find something different that can. You are in control of your life. Enjoy </p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shiloh</h1><p>“Now Shiloh I don’t want you to be
nervous, but we’re going to do a little experiment; your father told me your favorite
subject at school is science, and that you’re the best at experiments”, said
Dr. Sabini as she placed a folded bandana over Shiloh’s eyes. </p></article>]]></description>
